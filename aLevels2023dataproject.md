# Version 1
This data project provides information on A-level enrolment percentages per region and subject in schools in England for the year 2022-2023.

I started this project to support a relative's choice of where to study for his A-levels. We had two options: use data to support our decision or ask friends. It turned out to be more complicated than initially thought but highly rewarding. 

Since he is a science student, I wanted to see which schools had the highest percentage of key stage 4 (KS4) students progressing to science-focused studies in A-Levels (KS5). Those schools provided more encouragement in the sciences and maths, hence the numbers. I also wanted to see which schools produce students ending up in Russel group schools or Oxbridge (Oxford or Cambridge). Could we marry this data to see schools that, on average, deliver on these and more? 


## v1 Data Source: 
https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/ 
and 
https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/
The information is based on data collected via awarding organizations, the school census, and the Individualized Learner Record.
Suppression is applied to protect the disclosure of personal information or characteristics.
This source data describes the data included in the A-level and other 16 to 18 performances from 2022/23.

Note: Many schools were ommitted from the ministry of education's database. This project focuses on the schools reported on.
